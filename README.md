## ðŸ‘‹ `whoami`
A young guy that loves everything that orbits the computer world.   
I live in Italy and until now I have been a self-taught, but next year I will start university at Politecnico di Milano and I will study Copmuter Science Engineering. 

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in...
...Web development, Hacking, OS and eletronics. I have a lot of interests, I have tried a lot of stuff, but my aim is to get a steady fundation.
I am at the begining of the path and I am very curious, I cannot wait to see what will happen in the future.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning...
...Hugo, React, Python (Flask, Bots, Pygame) and Linux.
I have good fundations with Javascript and Python and I am trying some of the technology that is available.
I am getting decent good in React and feeling comfortable with Linux, so the learning curve is certantly going up ðŸ“ˆ!
